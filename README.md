Advancement Frames is a very simple mod that adds one item, the  Advancement Frame (who would have guessed), which allows you to display your Advancements

 

Frames can be crafted with an emerald and some stick at any time

Once placed they will open a GUI where the player will be able to select one of his earned advancement or close the gui and leave the item empty if he desires.

When an advancement has been selected the block will display it and will show the advancement name & person who earned it when being looked at
